# Experimental Design and Pandas

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES for today

* Define a problem and types of data
* Identify data set types
* Define the data science workflow
* Apply the data science workflow to real data
* Create an iPython Notebook to import, format, and clean using the Pandas library

</section>

# Experimental Design and Pandas

## Pre work

Before this lesson, you should already be able to:

* Create, open and create and iPython Notebook
* Have completed python pre-work

</section>

# Last Lesson Review

## Data Science Workflow
1. **Identify** the Business Problem
2. **Acquire** Raw Data
3. **Parse and Mine** the Data: **data munging**
4. **Transform** the data: Feature engineering
5. **Select** and tune the Model: **Model Selection** and **Feature Selection**
6. **Present/ implement the results**: Visualization, deploy to production

2. **Acquire** Raw Data
3. **Parse** the Data

# Example
Determine the association of foods in the home with child dietary intake. Using one 24-hour recall from the cross-sectional NHANES 2007-2010 we will determine the factors associated with food available in the homes of American children and adolescents. We will test if reported availability of fruits, dark green vegetables, low fat milk or sugar sweetened beverages available in the home increases the likelihood that children and adolescents will meet their USDA recommended dietary intake for that food.

# Hypothesis
![slide SMART](/assets/02/questions-hypothesis.png)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Specific
* How data was collected:
    * 24-hour recall, self-reported

* What data was collected:
    * Fruits, dark green vegetables, low fat milk or sugar sweetened beverages, always vs. rarely available

* How data will be analyzed:
    * Using USDA recommendations as a gold-standard to measure the association

* The specific hypothesis & direction of the expected associations:
    * Children will be more likely to meet their recommended intake level

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# S.M.A.R.T

* Measurable: Food, Daily Intake
* Attainable: Determining association, correlation not causation
* Reproducible: Anyone with the data and scripts / tools can reach the same conclusions
* Time bound: Using one 24-hour recall from NHANES 2007-2010

Context is key

# Data Types
### CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA
All information is determined at the same time: A snapshot
### LONGITUDINAL DATA
The information is collected over a period of time: A recording
Time Series
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA
![activity S.M.A.R.T.](/assets/02/cross-sectional.png)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA
Strengths

* Population based
* Generalizable
* Reduced cost for data collection

Weaknesses

* Separation of cause and effect would be impossible (because causes precede their effects in time)
    * Some causal Inference methods would challenge that
* Variables/cases with long duration are over-represented

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Longitudinal Data / Time Series
![Longitudinal](/assets/02/longitudinal-data.png)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Longitudinal Data / Time Series

Strengths

* Unambiguous temporal sequence - exposure precedes outcome
* Multiple outcomes can be measured

Weaknesses

* Expense
* Takes a long time to collect data
* Vulnerable to missing data

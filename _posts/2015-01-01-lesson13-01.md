# Review: Decision Trees and Random Forests

# NLP

classify, translate, infer sentiment, infer topics, find associations and links,
translation, summarize,....
Named entity recognition
spelling
# NLP Vocabulary

* Corpus
* Token
*

# Vectorizing text
Transform the raw text into vectors that can be numerically compared
Extract numerical features from text

* tokenizing strings and giving an integer id for each possible token, for instance by using white-spaces and punctuation as token separators.
* counting the occurrences of tokens in each document.
* normalizing and weighting with diminishing importance tokens that occur in the majority of samples / documents.

# Tokenize

# Bag of words

The Bag of Words representation
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#the-bag-of-words-representation

Documents are described by word occurrences while completely ignoring the relative position information of the words in the document.

# TFIDF
Tf means term-frequency while tfâ€“idf means term-frequency times inverse document-frequency. This was originally a term weighting scheme developed for information retrieval (as a ranking function for search engines results), that has also found good use in document classification and clustering.

# Lemmatization and Stemming

# Stopwords

# POS - Tagging

# Hashing Trick

# Libraries

* Scikit
* NLTK
* Spacy
* Gensim

# Install a few things

conda install BeautifulSoup4
nltk

# 4 teams

* get the data
* clean up the text: remove punctuation, html markup, numbers, stop words, tokenize
    and return one long paragraph per document
* process all the reviews, store into an array
* train a RF
* assess on the tesy set

# THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW

* A methodology for doing Data Science

* Similar to the scientific method

* Helps produce reliable and reproducible results
    * **Reliable**:  Accurate findings
    * **Reproducible**:  Others can follow your steps and get the same results

</section>

<section data-markdown>

6 steps

1. **Identify** the Business Problem
2. **Acquire** Raw Data
3. **Explore** the Data aka **data munging**
4. **Transform** the data: Feature engineering
5. **Select** and tune the Model: **Model Selection** and **Feature Selection**
6. **Present/ implement the results**: Visualization, deploy to production

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 1: **Identify** the Business Problem

* Identify Business or Product objectives,
* Identify and Hypothesize Goals
* Define Success Metrics,
* Find the right datasets

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 2: **Acquire** Raw Data

* Availability and Timeliness

* Security and Privacy

* Relevance, Bias, Sampling methods

* Sources

* Heterogeneity: databases, files (csv, pdf), 3rd Party, API, ...

* Tools

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 3: Parse aka Data Munging

### Learn, Understand
* Documentation, Data dictionnaries

### Explore
* Perform exploratory surface analysis via filtering, sorting, and simple visualizations
* Exploratory Statistics
* Distribution, Trends, outliers

### Assess its relevance

* Time constraints: when is the data produced? is it too old?
* Formats (dates, amounts, Imperial vs Metric)


</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 4: Mine aka Feature engineering

### Clean

* Format and clean data in Python (dates, number signs, formatting)
* Missing values, imbalanced sets, normalization

### Create new variables to gain more insights, more signal from the data

For instance

* Date time Features:: Number of days before event, week #, season, holiday, evening vs morning
* Combine, multiply, polynomial, log, inverse, ...
* Group by pattern
* Use domain knowledge
* One Hot Encoding
* Remove features to strengthen good features

</section>

# ETL

Steps 3-5 are called ETL: Explore Transform Load

Evolved from batch processing in data warehouse environments

</section>


<section data-markdown>
# Step 6: Model Selection

* What's a model?
* What's the simplest model

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Step 5: Model Selection

* Select the Right type of models for the task: Regression, Classification, detection, outlier detection, ...


* Select the metric: precision, recall, accuracy, ...., RMSE, ranking
* Try different models, see how they perform,
* Fine tune their parameters

# Step 6: The results

Summarize findings with storytelling techniques

* Prediction scores
* Data visualization: plots, dashboards
* System Integration, Deploy to production

Identify follow-up problems and questions

    <h1>What is Data Science?</h1>
    <p class = 'big_title white'>THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW</p>

</section>


<section data-markdown>
# THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW

* A methodology for doing Data Science

* Similar to the scientific method

* Helps produce reliable and reproducible results
    * **Reliable**:  Accurate findings
    * **Reproducible**:  Others can follow your steps and get the same results

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW

6 steps

1. **Identify** the Business Problem
2. **Acquire** Raw Data
3. **Parse and Mine** the Data: **data munging**
4. **Transform** the data: Feature engineering
5. **Select** and tune the Model: **Model Selection** and **Feature Selection**
6. **Present/ implement the results**: Visualization, deploy to production

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 1: **Identify** the Business Problem

* Identify Business or Product objectives,
* Identify and Hypothesize Goals
* Define Success Metrics,
* Find the right datasets

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 2: **Acquire** Raw Data

* Availability and Timeliness

* Security and Privacy

* Relevance, Bias, Sampling methods

* Sources: 3rd party platforms, in house, public data

* Heterogeneity: databases, files (csv, pdf), 3rd Party, API, ...

* Tools: 3rd party (Informatica, Jitterbit), scripts, spreadsheets, ...

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 3: Parse and Mine aka Data Munging

### Learn, Understand
* Documentation, Data dictionnaries

### Explore
* Perform exploratory surface analysis via filtering, sorting, and simple visualizations
* Exploratory Statistics
* Distribution, Trends, outliers

### Assess its relevance

* Time constraints: when is the data produced? is it too old?
* Formats (dates, amounts, Imperial vs Metric)

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 4: Feature engineering

### Clean

* Format and clean data in Python (dates, number signs, formatting)
* Invalid values
* Missing values, imbalanced sets, normalization

### Create new variables to gain more insights, more signal from the data

For instance

* Date time Features:: Number of days before event, week #, season, holiday, evening vs morning
* Combine, multiply, polynomial, log, inverse, ...
* Group by pattern
* Use domain knowledge
* One Hot Encoding
* Remove features to strengthen good features

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# ETL

Steps 3,4 are called ETL:  [Extract Transform Load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)

Evolved from batch processing in data warehouse environments

Creating the final dataset on which to apply models

* Combine
* Clean
* Complement
* Create

</section>


<section data-markdown>
# Step 5: Model Selection

* What's a model?
* What's the simplest model?

</section>
<section data-markdown>
# Step 5: Model Selection

What's a model?

One or a combination of algorithms

* Trained to the data
* With optimized parameters

Threshold, [Linear Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)

Note:
see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Step 5: Model Selection

* Select the Right type of models for the task: Regression, Classification, detection, outlier detection, ...


* Select the metric: precision, recall, accuracy, ...., RMSE, ranking
* Try different models, see how they perform,
* Fine tune their parameters

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Step 6: The results

Summarize findings with storytelling techniques

* Prediction scores
* Data visualization: plots, dashboards
* System Integration, Deploy to production

Identify follow-up problems and questions

</section>


<section data-markdown>
# Data Visualization

* [Friendships between NFL fans](https://research.facebook.com/blog/nfl-fan-friendships-on-facebook/)
* [New York City Transit Frequency ](http://www.tyleragreen.com/maps/new_york/)
* [Seasonal wind prediction](http://visualoop.com/blog/92379/seasonal-wind-prediction-with-project-ukko)
* Beatles

Note:
Take a 5mn break, talk about data visualization, dashboards
Heard about tufts?
Should at this point be at 1:15

# Example: The Online Retail Data Set  from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

[The Online Retail Data Set ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#)

Problem Statement:  “Using customer , determine how likely previous customers are to request a repeat delivery using

* Order history
* Shopping carts composition
* Demographic data

Classic RFM model: Recency, Frequency, Monetary

We can use the Data Science workflow to work through this problem.

</section>


<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail:  1) Identify the Problem

* Identify the business/product objectives.
* Identify and hypothesize goals and criteria for success.
* Create a set of questions to help you identify the correct data set.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 2) Identify and Acquire the Data

* Ideal data vs. data that is available
* What data is available for this example? Limitations?
* What kind of questions might we want to ask about the data?

Questions to ask about the data

* Is there enough data?
* Does it appropriately align with the question/problem statement?
* Can the dataset be trusted?  How was it collected?
    * Secondary data = we didn’t directly collect it ourselves
* Is this dataset aggregated / grouped?  Can we use the aggregation or do we need to get it pre-aggregated?

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 3) Parse and Mine the Data

1. Let's read the [Data dictionary](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#)
2. First look
3. Load the data in a Notebook start exploring
4. Outliers? Valid Data?
5. Format and clean the data
6. Any missing values?
7. Normalize?

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 4) Feature Engineering


* Extract meaning and classes from product descriptions
* Define Categories
* Cancelled order
* Total amount per order
* Total amount per Customer, Country, Day ....
* Special Days: Holidays, week ends,
* One hot Encoding

=> Potential for hundreds, throusands of features

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail:: 5) Model

* Find types of customers: Simple clustering
* Predict retention: Random Forests, Logistic Regression, ...
* Similarity between UK customers and Non UK: Vectorization,

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail:: 5) Model

The steps for model building are

* Select the appropriate model
* Build the model
* Evaluate and refine the model
* Predict outcomes and action items

=> back to step 2 (more data, other data), 3 (more cleanup), 4 (Add / Remove Features)

</section>
<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 6) Present the Results

* You have to effectively communicate your results for them to matter!
* Ranges from a simple email to a complex web graphic.
* Make sure to consider your audience.
* A presentation for fellow data scientists will be drastically different from a presentation for an executive.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 6) Present the Results

Key factors of a good presentation include

* Summarize findings with narrative and storytelling techniques

* Refine your visualizations for broader comprehension

* Present both limitations and assumptions

* Determine the integrity of your analyses

* Consider the degree of disclosure for various stakeholders

* Test and evaluate the effectiveness of your presentation beforehand

# Statistics Fundamentals

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

* Use NumPy and Pandas libraries to analyze datasets using basic summary statistics: mean, median, mode, max, min, quartile, inter-quartile range, variance, standard deviation, and correlation
* Create data visualizations - including: line graphs, box plots, and histograms- to discern characteristics and trends in a dataset
* Identify a normal distribution within a dataset using summary statistics and visualization: skewed
* **Key Concept: BIAS VS. VARIANCE**
* Complete dummy coding by hand

# Mean / Average

* Sum of all values divided by number of values

$$a = [2,4,6,8]$$

$$\bar{a} = \frac{(2 + 4 + 6 + 8)}{4} = 10 $$

$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum X_{i} $$

* Sensitive to outliers
* Other means: Harmonic mean, geometric mean
* In probability Expectation of X: $$\mathbb{E}\[X\]$$

# Median

The median refers to the midpoint in a series of numbers.

To find the median:

Arrange the numbers in order smallest to largest.

* If there is an odd number of values, the middle value is the median.

* If there is an even number of values, the  average of the middle two values is the  median.

</section>


<section data-markdown>
# Median examples

* $$a = [1,2,3,4,5] => median(a) = 3$$

* $$a = [1,2,3,4,5,6] => median(a) = \frac{3+4}{2} $$

* $$a = [10,12,20,30, 32,32, 34, 40, 1000, 10000]$$ $$=> median(a) = 32$$ but $$\bar{a} = 1121$$

More robust to outliers than mean

# Standard Deviation

$$\sigma = $$
Standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values

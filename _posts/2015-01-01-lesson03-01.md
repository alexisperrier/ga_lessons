# Mean / Average

* Sum of all values divided by number of values \\( \qquad \bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum X_{i} \\)

* Sensitive to outliers

* Other means: Harmonic mean
\\( \qquad H = \frac{n}{ \sum \frac{1}{x_i} } \\)

* In probability Expectation of X: \\(\mathbb{E}\[X\]\\)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Median

The median refers to the midpoint in a series of numbers.

Arrange the numbers in order smallest to largest.

* If there is an odd number of values, the middle value is the median.

* If there is an even number of values, the  average of the middle two values is the  median.

</section>


<section data-markdown>
# Median examples

* $$a = [1,2,3,4,5] => median(a) = 3$$

* $$a = [1,2,3,4,5,6] => median(a) = \frac{3+4}{2} $$

* $$a = [10,12,18,28, 32,34, 36, 40, 1000, 10000]$$ $$ median(a) = 33$$ but $$\bar{a} = 1121$$

More robust to outliers than mean

<section data-markdown>
# Standard Deviation

**Standard deviation** \\( \sigma \\)
 measures the amount of variation of a set of data values around its mean.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Standard Deviation

Both datasets have a mean of 100 but different SDs.![Std 03](assets/03/Comparison_standard_deviations.svg)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Bias vs Unbiased Standard Deviation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator

Biased: \\( \qquad \hat{\sigma} = \frac{1}{N} \sum (x_i - \bar{x} )^2   \\)

Unbiased: \\( \qquad \hat{\sigma} = \frac{1}{N -1} \sum (x_i - \bar{x} )^2   \\)

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Correlation

Correlation is a measure of the dependence between 2 variables X and Y.

* X increases => Y increases
    * positive correlation, think children's age => height

* X increases => Y decreases
    * negative correlation, think adult's age => eyesight

### Independent variables

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Correlation

Different ways to calculate correlation.

Most common one is [Pearson Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient)

$$ X = \{x_1, .... x_N\} \qquad Y = \{ y_1, ... , y_N\}  $$

Correlation between X and Y:

$$ \rho_{X,Y} =  \frac{ \sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})  }{ \sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 } \sqrt{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2 }    }  $$

where

\\( \bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \sum x_i \qquad and \qquad \bar{y} = \frac{1}{N} \sum y_i \\)

# QUARTILES AND INTERQUARTILE RANGE

Quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts.

The values that divide each part are called first, second, and third quartiles, denoted Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively.

The interquartile range (IQR) is Q3 - Q1, a measure of variability.

# Histograms
* slice your data into N range
* for each subrange you cont the number of samples in that range

Approximation of the distribution of the variable.

# Your turn!

| jupyter notebook

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline

Load the Online Retail dataset https://github.com/alexperrier/gads/blob/master/03_statistics_fundamentals/data/online_retail_clean.csv.csv

# LAB: Clean the data
Let's clean the data

1. Remove rows with:
    * Negative Quantities
    * Unit Prices of 0
    * Rows with Missing values

            How many remaining rows?
2. Stats: Mean, median, std, ... for Quantity and UnitPrice (df.describe())
        Anything striking ?

3. More cleaning maybe ?
        limit to the 95% quantile: df.UnitPrice.quantile(0.95) & df.Quantity.quantile(0.95)

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# LAB: Some visualizations
3. Plot the histograms and boxplot for Quantity and UnitPrice
        label your axes with plt.xlabel('...')

4. Interpret correlation graph using sns
        import seaborn as sns
        f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 16))
        sns.corrplot(df.sample(1000)[['Quantity','UnitPrice']], ax=ax)

<section data-markdown>
# Normal Distribution
\\( \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \\)
* Mean \\( \mu\\) determines the center of the distribution.
* Standard deviation  \\( \sigma^2 \\) determines the height and width of the distribution.

<section data-markdown>
# Central Limit Theorem

* Large number of samples
* Each sample is independent on the values of the other observations
* The mean of the samples follows a Normal Distribution with the same mean
* and variance equal to the variance of the samples divided by the sample size.

<section data-markdown>
# Skewness
Two metrics are commonly used to describe your distribution: skewness and kurtosis.

Skewness
In probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or even undefined.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Kurtosis
Kurtosis
Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are peaked or flat relative to a normal distribution.That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have a distinct peak near the mean, decline rather rapidly, and have heavy tails.

</section>

# Is your data Normally distributed?

# Correct Skewness

* Normality of data is an assumption in certain linear regression models
* Also impacts Confidence Intervals

# Data Types
## Continous
Numeric variables can take on a large range of non-predetermined, quantitative values. These are things such as height, income, etc.

## Categorical
Categorical variables can take on a specific set of variables.

These are things such as gender, colors, countries, fare level, courses, music genre, housing types, ....

## Continous to Categorical

* Age [0 to 120] becomes Age Group [0-18, 18-25, 25-35, ...]
* Free text becomes categories

<section data-markdown>
# Categorical - what's the problem?

* Need numbers not strings
* Coded as 1,2,3 induces order among categories

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Categorical

Convert category into N variables
ex:
In fact need N-1 not N
</section>


<section data-markdown>
# Categorical

We’ll draw out how categorical variables can be represented without implying order.

First, let’s choose a reference category.  This will be our “base” category.

It’s often good to choose the category with the largest sample size and a criteria that will help model interpretation.  If we are testing for a disease, the reference category would be people without the disease.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Let’s see our dummy variables.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Knowledge check

We can do this for a gender variable with two categories:  male and female.

How many dummy variables need to be created?
